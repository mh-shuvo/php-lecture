### What is PHP
PHP is a scripting language primarily used for web development. It can be embedded into HTML code, allowing developers to create dynamic content that interacts with databases and other server-side technologies. PHP code is executed on the server, generating HTML output that is then sent to the client's web browser.

### Why and How PHP was Created
PHP was designed to simplify web development by providing a straightforward and easy-to-learn syntax for generating dynamic content. It was intended to be embedded within HTML, allowing developers to mix code and markup seamlessly.

PHP was created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 as a set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries written in C. Initially, PHP stood for "Personal Home Page," reflecting its origins as a tool for managing Lerdorf's personal website. 

### PHP: Programming Language or Server-Side Language
PHP is both a programming language and a server-side scripting language. As a programming language, PHP provides a set of syntax and functionality for developing software applications. As a server-side scripting language, PHP runs on a web server, processing code and generating dynamic content in response to client requests.

### PHP: Past, Present, and Future
n the past, PHP was primarily used for building simple websites and web applications. However, with advancements in the language and the introduction of frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, and CodeIgniter, PHP has become a popular choice for building complex web applications and APIs.

Currently, PHP powers a significant portion of the web, with millions of websites and web applications relying on it for their backend functionality. The language continues to evolve with regular updates and improvements, ensuring its relevance in the ever-changing landscape of web development.

As for the future, PHP is expected to remain a prominent player in web development, particularly in the realm of server-side scripting. With ongoing development efforts and community support, PHP is likely to adapt to emerging technologies and trends, ensuring its longevity as a versatile and reliable tool for building web applications.

### How to run PHP code

You can run your PHP code by using webserver or in command line.

`For this moment we avoid web server.`

After download the PHP.x. You have to add the base path of `php.exe` in the OS global environment variable.
Then we can access it via terminal.
To check the PHP is successfully set or not you can run the following command:

        php -v

The result should be like this if you are install php 8.1.x

        PHP 8.1.10 (cli) (built: Aug 30 2022 18:05:49)
